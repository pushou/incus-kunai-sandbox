## goal:

To provide a Kunai-Sandbox, implemented as a nested and more secure virtual machine (VM) within a Debian Incus VM, for cybersecurity students (specifically, those in the IUT "Réseaux et Télécoms" program). The laboratory environment is provided (see project PDF). Nushell will be used to analyze data generated by Kunai.

## Security Notice for Instructors
During the build process for the Incus VM, a malware dataset from the NGSOTI project (accessible at https://helga.circl.lu/NGSOTI/malware-dataset) was downloaded to provide material for analysis. I am not responsible for your lab's security; you have been warned!

## install incus on your host
```bash
./install-incus.sh
```

## create profile
```bash
incus profile create kunai-sandbox < kunai-sandbox.profile
```
## launch VM
#### (16GiB is comfortable you can try with 8GiB if you have not sufficient resources)
```
incus launch images:debian/13/cloud sandbox-vm --vm --profile kunai-sandbox -c limits.cpu=2 -c limits.memory=16GiB
```
